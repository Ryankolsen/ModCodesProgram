# ModCodesProgram
Displays modification code details for a Mil-DTL5015 type connector

This program takes an existing text file of modification codes, reads the file and converts the file's contents to a String array. It then prompts the user for the desired modification code. Once entered, it uses a for loop to cycle through all existing codes and find a match. If a match is found it is printed to
the screen. If no match is found an error message prints stating this fact.

Please see screenshots in file titled "ModCodes Screenshots" for an example of this program.
